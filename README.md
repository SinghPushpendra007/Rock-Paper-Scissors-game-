# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game

I recently embarked on an exciting project to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using web development technologies, which allowed me to combine my coding skills with creativity. The game is structured using HTML, styled with CSS, and powered by JavaScript, making it a comprehensive showcase of my web development abilities.

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and engaging, featuring large, colorful buttons for rock, paper, and scissors. This design choice ensures that players can easily make their selections, enhancing the overall user experience. I focused on creating a visually appealing layout that is both modern and responsive, allowing the game to function seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The core game logic is implemented in JavaScript, which randomly generates the computer's choice and compares it to the player's selection to determine the winner. To make the game more interactive, I incorporated animations and sound effects that trigger with each selection, adding an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay.

Additionally, I included a scoring system that tracks the number of wins, losses, and ties, encouraging players to improve their skills and compete against themselves. This feature adds a competitive edge, making the game more engaging and replayable.

Overall, developing this Rock-Paper-Scissors game was a rewarding experience that not only solidified my understanding of web development concepts but also fueled my passion for creating interactive applications. I look forward to building more complex projects in the future!
